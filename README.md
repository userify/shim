The Userify shim creates users, manages sudo permissions, etc based on
the user accounts that you've configured in the Userify web console (https://console.userify.com)
or through the API. It wakes up once every 90 seconds, checks for things to do,
and goes back to sleep.

The shim is designed to be extremely lightweight and easy to integrate and
customize into cloudinit, chef recipes, puppet manifests, RPMs, DEBs,...
We're here to help. If you experience any issues, let us know.

It has zero requirements beyond what is included in every major distribution today.


System Requirements
-------------------

The Userify shim is very short (please read it for yourself)
and only requires:

*  Linux 2.6 or later
*  curl (command-line), sudo
*  Python 2.6 or later (for httplib timeout, simplejson)
*  HTTPS access to shim.userify.com (currently proxies are not supported)

These basics are *built-in* to most Linux distributions made in the last five years,
including Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS, OpenSUSE, Gentoo,
and derivatives.

Tested distributions: RHEL6, RHEL7, CentOS7, Amazon Linux, Ubuntu (min 10.04LTS), Debian (min 6).
Although currently no BSD-based UNIX (incl OS X) is supported, we are looking forward to that soon.


What does the installer do?
---------------------------

*   Create /opt/userify and credentials file in it (creds.py)
*   Patch /etc/rc.local (/etc/init.d/after.local on SUSE)
    with a link to the daemon
*   Creates an uninstall script at /opt/userify/uninstall.sh
*   Kicks off shim every 90 seconds


Using older versions of Linux
-----------------------------

Using an older Linux version such as RHEL5 where the default Python 2.4 is nearly ten years old? You'll need to install
a Python 2.7 RPM (check DAG's repo) which will leave your existing Python 2.4 available for system usage.
Then set the PYTHON environment variable to your new version of Python in /etc/rc.local as follows:

    PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2.6 /opt/userify/shim.sh &

(Note: installer.sh will no longer start shim.sh automatically.)
