The Userify shim creates users, manages sudo permissions, etc based on
the user accounts that you've configured in the Userify web console (https://console.userify.com)
or through the API. It wakes up once every 90 seconds, checks for things to do,
and goes back to sleep.

The shim is designed to be extremely lightweight and easy to integrate and
customize into cloudinit, chef recipes, puppet manifests, RPMs, DEBs,...
We're here to help. If you experience any issues, let us know.

It has zero requirements beyond what is included in every major distribution today.


System Requirements
-------------------

The Userify shim is very short (please read it for yourself)
and only requires:

*  Linux 2.6 or later
*  curl (command-line), sudo
*  Python 2.6 or later (for httplib timeout, simplejson)
*  HTTPS access (currently proxies are not supported)

These basics are *built-in* to most Linux distributions made in the last five years,
including Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS, OpenSUSE, Gentoo,
and derivatives.

Tested distributions: RHEL6, RHEL7, CentOS7, Amazon Linux, Ubuntu (min 10.04LTS), Debian (min 6).
Although currently no BSD-based UNIX (incl OS X) is supported, we are looking forward to that soon.


What does the installer do?
---------------------------

*   Create /opt/userify and credentials file in it (creds.py)
*   Patch /etc/rc.local (/etc/init.d/after.local on SUSE)
    with a link to the daemon
*   Creates an uninstall script at /opt/userify/uninstall.sh
*   Kicks off shim every 90 seconds


Using older versions of Linux
-----------------------------

Using an older Linux version such as RHEL5 where the default Python 2.4 is nearly ten years old? You'll need to install
a Python 2.7 RPM (check DAG's repo) which will leave your existing Python 2.4 available for system usage.
Then set the PYTHON environment variable to your new version of Python in /etc/rc.local as follows:

    PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2.6 /opt/userify/shim.sh &

(Note: installer.sh will no longer start shim.sh automatically.)

Troubleshooting
---------------

#### I'm using a cloud-init.yml file but once my host is launched my userify users don't work

This could be caused by any number of things, but if cloud-init runs into issues before reaching your `- curl ...`
command then any number of things could happen.  Due to timing issues and the contents of your cloud-init.yml file
this could happen all the time, or only very occasionally.

1. Make sure you don't have multiple calls to installing the userify shim.
2. If you have separate ssh access to the server:
    First, make sure you're logging the cloud-init output somewhere:
    ```yml
    output:
      all: '| tee -a /var/log/cloud-init-output.log'
    ```
    If you see something like the following in it:
    ```
    /opt/userify/shim.sh: line 26: -u: command not found
    curl: (23) Failed writing body (0 != 16011)
    ```
    then the userify shim isn't able to find python.  As the shim also attempts to install python as part of the process,
    the most common cause of this is from a timing issue with the package installer.  If you're able to, try uncommenting
    the `packages` section of your cloud-init file and see if that solves the problem.
3. Contact support or open an issue.
